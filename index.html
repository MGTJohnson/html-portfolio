                <p>
                    Welcome to my first HTML webiste where I have examples of small projects I have been working on solely using HTML. 
                    My Goal is to develop websites professionally and create some of the most beatiful looking products using everything that I can.
                    Please take some time to review what I have been up to the past few days.

                        <p>This was the second webpage I created in VS code using HTML 5, 
                            this is when I started to realise that I was actually having fun putting this together.
