<h1>The subjective and difficult art of telling someone your favorite films... list!</h1>
<h2>The top first 5 movies I could quickly think of at 2am list in no particular order;</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Goodfellas</h3>
<p>A legendary film set in 1950's america and onwards about Henry Hill, a young boy who falls in love with a life of crime and the alluring temptations of a crime family.</p><br />
<h3>2. Django (2012)</h3>
<p>One of Tarantinos best works (in my opinion) as we follow the live of a newly freed slave Django, who's live goal is to save his wife who has been sold to another plantation as punishment for trying to escape thier life of slavery.</p>
<h3>3. The Whale</h3>
<p>I'm not sure this film has made this list for the same reasons as other critics and is a little contravertial for me to add. Whilst the film itself has nothing special going for it story wise, niether falling back on interesting or beautiful vistas and landscape shots to hold the viewer. Instead what we get is an emotional rollercaoster of one man who has eaten himself to the end of his life and we watch as his life falls apart around him because of the life choices he has made. The acting in this film is simply beautiful on its own and does way more to speak for the film than traditional (and at the moment very popular) way of keeping an audience hooked. Instead you will be sitting through an uncomfortable couple of hours. If you have ever had issues with your weight in the past or have gotten to breaking points in life where you have thought the worst then this is the film for you.</p>
<h3>4. Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Obviosly this film is going to get added to the list. With a visualy breathtaking art style, accomponied by a spectacular soundtrack makes this film one of the most popular of the year it was released.</p>
<h3>5. Godzilla Minus one </h3>
<p>Finally we have Godzilla. After watching both Godzilla films that have come out of Japan lately I have to say I am mesmerised by the wonder of old school cinema being brought into the 21st Century. With a soundtrack that nods to the old and visula shots and stule that smack of the old film, Godzilla is like a small time machine that will send you back to the 70's sat in front of the screen watching the wolrds most famous and feared Kaiju rip through the city of Tokyo. Whilst it may not be winning any of the main stream awards this film really knows how to mix both old and new and bring something different to the industry, rather than just a rehash this feels like soemthing new that they are trying to build for the newer generations.</p>
