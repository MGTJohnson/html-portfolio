<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey, my name's Matthew, I cyrrently live in Manchester England and I'm trying my best to get a career in website development. For the past 4 years I've been working as a self employed
  plumber and realising it was no longer the industry for me I made the decision to get into web. At the moment I'm teaching myself to use HTML 5 
  with intentions to get deeper into CSS, Javascript, etc.

  Working for myself for years I realise the amount of time and work it takes to become dependant professionally and I want to take this into the
  the digital world. Already I can see that I can stretch out the creative part of my mind in order to create content and overcome the problems
  that come with the territory or writing code. I believe I'm addicted to the feeling of cracking something that's taken me an age to do throughout
  the day and a couple of months off the end of my life from the stress of it not working.
